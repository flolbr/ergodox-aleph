# Ergodox Aleph 1

Ergodox Aleph 1 is a modification of the [Ergodox Infinity][original].

Major changes include:

* Full Under-Key RGB
* Output header for additional RGB on bottom
* Through-hole diodes for easy soldering
* Replaced the expensive J-Link Needle port with a cheap J-Link socket

**I've only done the left board so far.**
