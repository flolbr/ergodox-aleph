# Ergodox Aleph 1

Ergodox [Aleph 1][aleph] is a modification of the [Ergodox Infinity][original].

Major changes include:

* Full Under-Key RGB
* Through-hole diodes for easy soldering
* Replaced the expensive J-Link Needle port with a cheaper J-Link socket
* RGB header for optional underglow
* Added stabiliser holes to 2U keys on thumb cluster
* Replaced discontinued USB ports with new parts

**I've only done the left board so far.**
